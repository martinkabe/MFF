There is a line with two numbers R and S on the input.

Fill the board with R rows and S columns with crosses (X) and circles (O) so that there are no 5 identical symbols in a row in any row, column or diagonal.

We reveal that for the sizes at which we test the task, random filling of the board has the required property with non-trivial probability.

Example: For input

5 6

is one of correct outputs

OXXXXO
OOXOOX
XXOOXX
XOOXXX
XXOXXO
